🛡️ OTP Bypass CTF Challenge

Welcome to the OTP Bypass CTF — a beginner-friendly web security challenge created to help learners understand how OTP validation flaws can be exploited.

🔍 About the Challenge

This CTF demonstrates a common web vulnerability where the One-Time Password (OTP) mechanism can be bypassed using tools like Burp Suite.
Participants must analyze the request parameters, identify weak validation logic, and bypass the OTP check to access the hidden flag.

The challenge is intentionally designed for beginners so they can learn:

- How OTP verification works

- How insecure server-side validation leads to bypass

- How to inspect & modify HTTP requests

- Basic Burp Suite workflow for web exploitation

🎯 Goal

Capture the flag 🎉
The only way to obtain the flag is by successfully bypassing the OTP validation.

🧠 Skills Learned

- Web Application Security Basics

- Request Inspection & Manipulation

- Burp Suite Interception

- Understanding Server-side Logic Flaws

- CTF Problem Solving
